    <p>This project was inspired by my years as a government policy analyst. I wanted to explore how government consultation processes could be more accessible for people who are underrepresented in policy decisions. I interviewed government officials across New Zealand and Singapore to find ways to make complex, written policies more interesting and transparent. I used these insights to prototype alternatives to a recent waste policy consultation document, which consisted of 160 pages of mostly written text. I reworded technical elements in the form of graphic icons, diagrams, and interactive maps and exercises. My focus group was people who speak English as a second language, and I found 20 participants to survey these alternatives. The results showed increased engagement and understanding from especially simple graphics. The interactive components were fun but sometimes challenging for users, especially for those who participated on their phones. Guidance by civic designer
