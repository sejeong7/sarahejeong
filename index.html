    <h1>Hello, I’m Sarah. Welcome to my page!</h1>
    
    <p>
      I am a multi-media designer committed to using art and data science to improve accessibility and participation in decisions that affect the communities around me. I believe in respecting and uplifting people in everything that I do, be it in climate policy teams or as an organizer of Great British Bake Off watch parties.

      I received a Bachelors in Public Policy from Princeton and Masters in City Planning from MIT, specializing in design and analytics. Lately I have been playing with graphic design tools, laser cutters and clay. If you’d like to see some of my creations, check out my portfolio!
